    <h1>Recommendations for the Olympic Peninsula</h1>
    <p>
      These recommendations, like this site, are a work in progress! They are meant to be in order as possible assuming a counterclockwise loop. 
      Please feel free to use them
      to help plan your trip out to the Olympic Peninsula. Please be sure to look up these spots before committing to going to them since they might be closed
      for construction/winter weather.  
    </p>
    <h2>Port Angeles/Sequim</h2>
    <p>
      I still haven't explored these towns too much, but they look kind of neat. I like stopping at the Hi-Way 101 Diner in Sequim (pronounced like "squim") to 
      get breakfast/take a break from driving.
    </p>

    <h2>Hike the Dungeness Spit</h2>
    <p>
      The Dungeness Spit trail is a narrow strip (or spit) of sand that juts out about 5 miles from the land. 
      It ends in a lighthouse with an attached museum. It's flat beach hike that is just over 10 miles round trip.
      You'll need $3 or a Refuge Entrance Pass to enter. This trail is good for bird watching and has no tree cover once you get to the sand 
      (be sure to bring sun screen if it's a sunny day)! Fun Fact: the spit is still growing as sediment continues to be deposited past the lighthouse at the 
      end of the trail.

    <h2>Lake Crescent</h2>
    <p>
      This is a cool lake that is super clear! You can see all the way to the bottom in most spots, and it is as deep as 624 feet! The clear water is caused 
      by the lack of nutrients to support algae growth, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This is known as an oligotrophic lake.
      Apparently, nutrients have been left out of the lake since it was created by a glacier carving into the nutrient-lacking rocks of mountains. 
      There are a few short hikes nearby to break up a drive: Marymere Falls and Moments in Time trail.

    <h2>Forks</h2>
    <p>
      Go here for all things Twilight.
    </p>

    <h2>Rialto Beach</h2>
    <p>
      There are a ton of sea stacks to see at this beach. If you show up during low tide, you can see starfish!
    </p>

    <h2>Hoh Rain Forest</h2>
    <p>
      Check out the Hall of Mosses trail for a quick hike! If you're lucky, you'll see an elk munching on the brush! If the park is too busy to enter the actual
      National Park area, don't be afraid to take one of the trails off the main road into the park. I've had just as much fun on them as the Hall of Mosses. 
    </p>

    <h2>Beaches on Beaches</h2>
    <p>
      There are several beaches off the side of Highway 101: Ruby Beach, Kalaloch Beach 4 through 1, and South Beach. They're all slightly different from 
      each other and fun little stops if you want to stretch the legs and maybe even see some bald eagles!
    </p>

    <h2>Kalaloch Big Cedar Nature Trail</h2>
    <p>
      Check this short stop out after Ruby Beach. Will take less than 30 minutes to see some big Cedar Trees!
    </p>

    <h2>Lake Quinault</h2>
    <p>
      Cool lake with a scenic loop to drive. If you want to stay here, there are some cool lodging options! It is also home to the world's largest
      Sitka Spruce!
    </p>

    <h2>Ocean Crest Resort</h2>
    <p>
      This is a nice and affordable hotel in Moclips, WA. It is right on the Pacific Ocean and has amazing sunset views! Moclips has some beaches that you can 
      actually drive onto, which is pretty unique to me!
